# sign-up-form

The purpose of this exercise is to help me learn the ins and outs of forms in HTML. I hope to learn the basics of creating a functional and easy to understand sign up form for prospective users. There will be some additional styling using CSS and even some minor Javascript to make the form work as desired. I hope to have a better understanding of forms after this project.
